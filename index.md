<img class="profile-picture" src="picture.jpeg">

Hi! I am a student Bachelor Applied Computer Sciences PXL at PXL University Hasselt. Graduated with an associates degree at PXL in 2023.

## Associates Degree Programming

During my associates degree there was mainly a focus on .NET, specifically C#, [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui). During my 6 month internship at [PrintSimple](https://www.printsimple.eu/) i learned PHP Content Management Systems like Drupal & Laravel, where i created a Project Tracking Platform in Laravel.
